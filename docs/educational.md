# Educational Pricing

Educational institutions can get a **50% discount** when they purchase 20 or more copies through [Apple School Manager](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/apple-school-manager/welcome/web).

Please [contact Apple](https://support.apple.com/contact) if you need help with Educational Pricing.

However, if you're a film student, or in a country where Apple hardware and software is insanely expensive, please don't hesitate to [reach out](/support/) for some kind of sponsorship agreement, as we love helping out emerging filmmakers!

Alternatively, as Gyroflow Toolbox is **open source**, you can also [build it yourself via GitHub](https://github.com/latenitefilms/GyroflowToolbox).
