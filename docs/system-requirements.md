# System Requirements

Gyroflow Toolbox requires **Final Cut Pro 10.6.5** or later, on **macOS Monterey 12.6** or later.

It works great on the latest **Final Cut Pro 11.2** release.

It works best on the latest Apple Silicon Mac's, however Intel is also supported.

Unfortunately, currently Gyroflow Toolbox won't work on Final Cut Pro for iPad, however if Apple does add third party FxPlug4 support, we'll definitely look into this!
